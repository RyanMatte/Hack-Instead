Welcome to our Hack Instead Project by Abbey Kerkmann and Ryan Matte

We are 4th year students at the University of Ottawa studying Computer Science and Software Engineering who are eager to work on our project called ORCT2 Calculator!
Inspired by the classic game, Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, we will be building a mobile application that helps players price the rides they have built using a number of different factors.
